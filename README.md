# Mini Machine Learning Projects

## Diverse ML Topics with Small Data:
* Undertook multiple ML topics using relatively small datasets to ensure a comprehensive understanding.
* Accompanied each project with data visualization to enhance insights.
## Topics Covered:
* Regression and Predictive Modeling: Implemented Simple Linear Regression, Multi-Linear Regression, and Polynomial Linear Regression.
* Classification and Ensemble Methods: Applied Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
* Naive Bayes and K-means: Explored Naive Bayes classifiers and utilized K-means clustering for data analysis.
